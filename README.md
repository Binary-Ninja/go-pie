## Requirements

This application was built on Python 3.9.7.
### pygame 2.0.3
`pip install pygame`

Pygame 2 is an SDL2 wrapper for Python.
### pyngrok 5.1.0

`pyngrok` is optional. This library allows localhost ports to be opened to the internet and made public.
Without this library, you cannot host public servers from localhost, but you may still join any server.
